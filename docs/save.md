# Save Command

## Syntax
`save`

## Description
The `save` command allows you to manually save your character's current progress to the database. This ensures that your experience points, health, mana, and other stats are preserved between game sessions.

## When to Use
While the game automatically saves your progress in certain situations (such as when you level up or quit), it's a good practice to use the `save` command after:
- Gaining significant experience points
- Before logging out
- After completing difficult encounters
- Any time you want to ensure your progress is preserved

## Related Commands
- `quit` - Saves your progress and exits the game
- `score` - Displays your current stats
