    name: "The Temple of Mota"
    description: |
      You are in the southern end of the temple hall in the Temple of Mota.
      The temple has been constructed from giant marble blocks, eternal in
      appearance, and most of the walls are covered by ancient wall paintings
      picturing gods, giants and peasants.
        Large steps lead down through the grand temple gate, descending the huge
      mound upon which the temple is built and ends on the temple square below.
        Equally large steps lead UP through a small door into the ENTRANCE to MUD 
      SCHOOL.  (type 'up' to go to MUD SCHOOL.)  A small plaque is on this wall.

          This world was built on the foundation of those who came before. It 
          draws inspiration from ROM 2.4, which in turn was shaped by MERC and 
          the original DikuMUDâ€”engines that brought countless adventures to life.

          With appreciation for the creators who laid the path:

          Hans Staerfeldt, Katja Nyboe, Tom Madsen,
          Michael Seifert, and Sebastian Hammer (DikuMUD)

          Hatchet, Furey, and Kahn (MERC)

          Russ Taylor (ROM 2.4)

          A new chapter begins here.

      Midgaard River.  All around you is the bustle of Southern Midgaard--
      shopkeepers on break, a town gossip or two prattling away.  You hear the
      river lapping at the pilings of the dock by Kate's Diner, which is to your
      north.  Emerald Avenue begins to the south, the Promenade continues west,
      and the concourse ends to your east.

    description: |
      The smells of baking bread and simmering stew lead you dancing through
      the doorway of the diner.  No greasy spoons to be seen here-- the
      booth walls are covered in casual paisleys; the chairs are carved wood,
      rescued from garage sales.  Most tables have chess or backgammon boards
      carved and painted on their fingertip-smooth tops.  The refrain of some
      musical or other from the 1930's blends with the dusty golden light and the
      wonderful smells to put you completely at ease.  A huge picture window
      looks out over the Midgaard River, and a doorway leads north onto the dock
      and the South Bank river landing, while the main entrance to the south
      returns you to Austral Square.
        On most days you will find Kate here, testing a batch of stew or brewing
      a special pot of cinnamon coffee, eerily just in time for your arrival
      Pull up a chair, perhaps play a game, and take time out to talk.

          River, and a boat or two floats lazily past.  Across the river you can see
          the Levee and the Guild of Thieves, but they seem very far away from all
          of this...

      scraps of paper fly around the room.  You blink as the dust you've stirred 
      up stings your eyes, and take a look around the shop.  This shop is cluttered 
      with old pieces of parchment, stacks of books, and odd scraps.  A desk with 
      slightly less clutter than the rest of the shop is in front of you.  A scroll 
      case full of scrolls is behind the desk.  A bookcase is to the right of you,

      step onto a soft bearskin rug and look around.  A simple bed lies against
      the far wall.  At the foot of it is a sturdy, ironbound chest, most likely
      full of Melancholy's trappings from her adventuring days.  On a small table
      under a window to the east is a vase with a single white rose.  Other than

      this is some weird version of windows.  In a flash of revelation, you
      realize that you've entered the Temple of Stupid.
