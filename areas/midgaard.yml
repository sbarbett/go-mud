    name: "The Temple of Mota"
    description: |
      You are in the southern end of the temple hall in the Temple of Mota.
      The temple has been constructed from giant marble blocks, eternal in
      appearance, and most of the walls are covered by ancient wall paintings
      picturing gods, giants and peasants.
        Large steps lead down through the grand temple gate, descending the huge
      mound upon which the temple is built and ends on the temple square below.
        Equally large steps lead UP through a small door into the ENTRANCE to MUD 
      SCHOOL.  (type 'up' to go to MUD SCHOOL.)  A small plaque is on this wall.

          This world was built on the foundation of those who came before. It 
          draws inspiration from ROM 2.4, which in turn was shaped by MERC and 
          the original DikuMUDâ€”engines that brought countless adventures to life.

          With appreciation for the creators who laid the path:

          Hans Staerfeldt, Katja Nyboe, Tom Madsen,
          Michael Seifert, and Sebastian Hammer (DikuMUD)

          Hatchet, Furey, and Kahn (MERC)

          Russ Taylor (ROM 2.4)

          A new chapter begins here.

      Midgaard River.  All around you is the bustle of Southern Midgaard--
      shopkeepers on break, a town gossip or two prattling away.  You hear the
      river lapping at the pilings of the dock by Kate's Diner, which is to your
      north.  Emerald Avenue begins to the south, the Promenade continues west,
      and the concourse ends to your east.

    description: |
      The smells of baking bread and simmering stew lead you dancing through
      the doorway of the diner.  No greasy spoons to be seen here-- the
      booth walls are covered in casual paisleys; the chairs are carved wood,
      rescued from garage sales.  Most tables have chess or backgammon boards
      carved and painted on their fingertip-smooth tops.  The refrain of some
      musical or other from the 1930's blends with the dusty golden light and the
      wonderful smells to put you completely at ease.  A huge picture window
      looks out over the Midgaard River, and a doorway leads north onto the dock
      and the South Bank river landing, while the main entrance to the south
      returns you to Austral Square.
        On most days you will find Kate here, testing a batch of stew or brewing
      a special pot of cinnamon coffee, eerily just in time for your arrival
      Pull up a chair, perhaps play a game, and take time out to talk.

          River, and a boat or two floats lazily past.  Across the river you can see
          the Levee and the Guild of Thieves, but they seem very far away from all
          of this...

      scraps of paper fly around the room.  You blink as the dust you've stirred 
      up stings your eyes, and take a look around the shop.  This shop is cluttered 
      with old pieces of parchment, stacks of books, and odd scraps.  A desk with 
      slightly less clutter than the rest of the shop is in front of you.  A scroll 
      case full of scrolls is behind the desk.  A bookcase is to the right of you,

      step onto a soft bearskin rug and look around.  A simple bed lies against
      the far wall.  At the foot of it is a sturdy, ironbound chest, most likely
      full of Melancholy's trappings from her adventuring days.  On a small table
      under a window to the east is a vase with a single white rose.  Other than

      this is some weird version of windows.  In a flash of revelation, you
      realize that you've entered the Temple of Stupid.

      Clan Road seems to widen here slightly, allowing more traffic to 
      travel through the area.  To the south is another entrance to the busy
      pub.  This door is also open wide and spilling forth the sounds of
      happy patrons.  Clan Road continues to the east and west.

      You are at the eastern end of Clan Road.  To the east of you, the  
      tall wall around the city looms up before you and casts its shadow on
      you.  Clan Road continues to the west.

    name: "A Money Changer's Room"
    description: |
      A few strategically placed lanterns keep this place well-lit in the 
      absence of any windows.  The room is surprisingly well appointed with  
      tapestries hanging on the walls.  You'd wager your life the moneylender's
      guards are behind them, as there are none here.  The moneylender himself
      works from behind a large desk, no doubt holding a fortune in gold and silver.
      A smallish sign hangs on the wall, lettered in common.

      Dive.  That's all you can say about this place; its a
      dive.  You step carefully over the dead and/or drunk sailors
      on the floor toward the center of the room.  There's no
      decorations on the wall; they've all been ripped down in anger
      or for use as weapons at one time or another.  Looking around,
      you search vainly for a clean table to sit at, and then give up.

      The busy pub is filled with patrons.  People are laughing and singing.
      A minstrel plays his lute in another part of the pub, and a few people
      are even dancing.  Andy, the pubs owner, wanders around and checks to see
      that the needs of his customers are met.  The bar is to your south.  East
      of you is another section of the pub.  You know that there are rooms to
      be had somewhere around here...

      This part of the pub is filled with dancing and singing.  A wandering
      minstrel is on a chair in a corner with his lute.  A busty red headed
      woman is standing near him and singing a tale of comedic heroism. Drunk
      men sit laughing at their tables and busy bar maids weave through the
      crowd with full mugs and horns of ale and mead.  Another part of the pub
      is located to your west. The bar is to the south.  A set of steps occupy
      in a corner of the room.  They lead up to the inn section of this
      prosperous establishment.

      A long mahogany bar is set in the back of the pub.  Mugs line a shelf
      behind the bar.  Bottles of strong, nasty looking liquids decorate one
      of the lower shelves.  A large cask rests on a table behind the bar.  A
      strong but friendly-looking bartender stands next to the cask polishing
      glasses.  A couple of the bar maids stand in a corner and throw the most
      inviting glances your way.

      You are standing upstairs from Andy's Pub at Andy's Inn.  A few chairs
      and a couple of end tables give the room a `homey' atmosphere.  A large
      stone fireplace burns brightly against one wall and warms the room.  A
      large oak desk is nestled in one corner of the room.  A small man with
      wire-framed glasses sits behind the desk working dilligently on his books.
      He looks up as you enter the room.  He looks at you quizzically.  He is
      probably waiting for you to ask him for a room.
